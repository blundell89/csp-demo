# CSP Demo

Includes a site (`1.wine-inventory`) that is vulnerable to XSS attacks. When the `bad-server` is run and data is thrown at it from a XSS attack (see the wine-inventory `README`), it will output the data in a console log.

A suitable CSP and refactoring is also available for reference in `2.wine-inventory-with-csp`.

For covering information, see the `slides` folder `README` to run some slides.
